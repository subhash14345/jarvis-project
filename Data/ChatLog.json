ML is a type of AI that enables systems to learn from experience and adapt to new data.\n* DL (Deep Learning): A subset of ML that involves the use of artificial neural networks to analyze and interpret data. DL is a type of ML that is particularly well-suited to tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and decision making."

It is a natural and essential aspect of human life, and it plays a crucial role in the reproduction and continuation of species.\n\nIn humans, sex is typically categorized into two main categories: male and female. Males have XY chromosomes, testes, and produce sperm, while females have XX chromosomes, ovaries, and produce eggs. However, it's essential to note that sex is a complex and multifaceted concept that can also involve aspects of gender identity, sexual orientation, and expression.\n\nSexual activity, or sexual intercourse, is the physical act of reproduction between two people, typically involving the union of male and female reproductive organs. It is a natural and essential part of human relationships, and it can also be an important aspect of emotional intimacy and bonding between partners.\n\nIt's important to approach sex with respect, responsibility, and open communication, and to prioritize consent, safety, and mutual respect in all sexual encounters."

The input string `3 + 5` is parsed as an expression `(E ...)` .\n2. The first part of the expression is `3`, which is a term `(T ...)` .\n3. The term `3` is a single digit, represented by the `(3)` node.\n4. The `+` operator is represented by the `(+)` node.\n5. The second part of the expression is `5`, which is another term `(T ...)` .\n6. The term `5` is a single digit, represented by the `(5)` node.\n\n**LL(1) Parser Table:**\n\nHere is the LL(1) parser table for the given grammar:\n```\n  | E | T | + | $ (end of input)\n------------------------------------\nE | E+T | T |  |  |\nT |  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n```\n**How the LL(1) Parser Works:**\n\n1. The parser starts at the top of the parse tree, with the input string `3 + 5`.\n2. The parser looks up the current input symbol (`3`) in the LL(1) table and determines that it matches the `T` production.\n3. The parser creates a new node for the `T` production and adds it to the parse tree.\n4. The parser looks up the next input symbol (`+`) in the LL(1) table and determines that it matches the `+` production.\n5. The parser creates a new node for the `+` production and adds it to the parse tree.\n6. The parser looks up the next input symbol (`5`) in the LL(1) table and determines that it matches the `T` production again.\n7. The parser creates a new node for the `T` production and adds it to the parse tree.\n8. The parser reaches the end of the input string and stops.\n\nThe resulting parse tree shows the syntactic structure of the input string, with each node representing a phrase or word and its relationship to other nodes."
